I referenced both the homework example and ChatGPT for this assignment. I was able to look at the homework example and figure out what needed to be changed to meet the homework specifications, that was easy. I used ChatGPT to enhance some of the features of the game. Specifically, once I had the code written, I asked ChatGPT how to make the flipImage() function turn the card over and flip it back over until a match was made. Once a match was made, I asked it to remove those "cards" and at the very end, I wanted an alert that the game was finished and for it to automatically start over. 

I found that this week I was able to easily enhance those using ChatGPT whereas last week I really struggled. I have honestly been struggling with understanding assigning names to functions etc. I thought they had to be named specific things in order to work for whatever reason. This week that kind of clicked. I need more practice with being comfortable naming those and will probably rework the CodeAcademy lessons. I find ChatGPT more useful for enhancing small segments of code rather than trying to write entirely.
