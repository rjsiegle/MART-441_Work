##Week Two: ChatGPT Reflection

The code I was provided when I copied the assignment into ChatGPT was as follows:

console.log("Favorite Websites:");
console.log("- Website 1");
console.log("- Website 2");
console.log("- Website 3");

console.log("Favorite Games:");
console.log("- Game 1");
console.log("- Game 2");
console.log("- Game 3");

console.log("Favorite Artists and Their Cultural Importance:");
console.log("- Artist 1: Description of cultural importance");
console.log("- Artist 2: Description of cultural importance");
console.log("- Artist 3: Description of cultural importance");

The console.log function was thoroughly discussed in the Codecademy lesson, so I was very comfortable with putting that together without the assistance of ChatGPT. Additionally, I believe I linked a script to my 341 website at one point, so that was also familiar. There was nothing contained within the code provided by ChatGPT that really did anything for me.

That said, my thoughts on ChatGPT and generative AI code are that it is a tool. As a tool, it can absolutely be utilized to improve upon code with the caveat being that as a tool, it lacks the fundamental critical thinking capacity of a human being. I have used ChatGPT in the past to assist in understanding the base of how a code should be written, but one problem that I've encountered is that it often gives incorrect answers. For example, when I used TouchDesigner in another course, which is Visual Programming, there were times where I couldn't resolve an issue and attempted to use ChatGPT to problem solve, and more often than not, it was not helpful. The good thing was that because I understood what I was asking of it, I could recognize when it was not giving a correct answer and could attempt to guide it to see if an answer was available. Unfortunately most of the resources for that program are complex wiki's or YouTube video tutorials. 

If ChatGPT is used as a tool for improving upon or further educating oneself, I don't see any issue with using it. It can help narrow down solutions to a problem, but the core problem has to be understood by the person using it. As far as directly copying and pasting code from it, I think that is largely dependant on the volume of code and it's complexity. If someone takes a complex script directly from ChatGPT, not only do I presume they would likely encounter issues, but I'd also be highly concerned about plagiarism. There is so much open source code available and a lot of programmers do seem to be happy to share, that I find taking large chunks of code from ChatGPT to be unneccessary and unethical. It doesn't advance anyone's knowledge or make them a better programmer if they do that.
