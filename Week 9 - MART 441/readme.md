I did have to use chatgpt for some assistance on this assignment because the initial file I chose was extensive and I kept getting "undefined" results. It was too large to manually check the JSON file. I followed the format of the assignment example for AJAX1.html and the one issue I ran into was also with undefined results, but modifying my code and then adding a plug in helped to fix that. 


Also, I want to point out that despite saving a local file, I still had to use my terminal and open chrome with the following command: 

open -a "Google Chrome" --args --disable-web-security --allow-file-access-from-files --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome_dev_test

I also had downloaded node.js and I really don't understand if those two things were interconnected or not, but it was another area where I did rely on chatGPT for help. 

Also the data set used was found at https://api.fda.gov/food/enforcement.json and the results were much easier to look at. I have looked into converting .csv into JSON before and I think that would have probably been easier for me and is something I may still attempt just because it's something I've been genuinely curious about for a few years.
