For this week, I did use chatgpt to help with some minor adjustments with text, but I predominantly used the example file. I could do a lot of the assignment using a CDN, 
but when it came to implementing my model, I had to just copy the libraries from the homework assignment into my folders for this week. I did download the three.js library
from the homework but I could not get it to work correctly for whatever reason. 

This was a really fun and easy week actually! Once I got past the library errors and
the confusing errors from the cdn's it was cake! I used a pretty bad object i made in tinder cad for another class but it's cool to see how something made there can work here!
