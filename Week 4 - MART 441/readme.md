##Reflections on Using AI

I had a really difficult time with this assignment. It was not the individual components,
those all make sense to me. It is however, how to tie them all together and make it work. I did
end up having to use AI to help. I wrote my own game following the homework tutorial structure, but
when I tried to put a function in to start the game or restart the game, I could not get it to work. All in all, I spend around 3 days working on this assignment and ended up turning to ChatGPT just to get a game that kind of meets the requirements. I am going to include both my version with my notes and the AI generated version. 

I think that I just need to continue to spend time trying to understand how these different components
work together and if there is an order in which they need to be written, what that is. I am hoping the
JavaScript books I ordered will be useful. 

One thing I had noticed with AI is that adding things in once it has generated the initial code is that it often comes back wrong and you have to ask it multiple times. When I asked for help with my own code to get it to work, it broke it. I did eventually get it to work for a restart but it was repopulating the buttons and no matter how many time I told it what it was doing,  it just kept writing crazier and crazier code! I think the more I work with JavaScript, I am seeiing that it's ok for writing it's own code, but for working with existing code where help is needed to add something, it isn't really that efficient.
