##Week 6 Read Me

For transparency, I did use ChatGPT a little bit this week to assist with finding errors. I  used it to help check my code and to assist in fixing an issue I was running into. ChatGPT is where the sessionStorage suggestion came from when I was running into an issue using localStorage. I suspect my issue with localStorage was being caused by a small syntax error I had missed. It initially worked, and ChatGPT suggested I changed it. 

I am finding that ChatGPT is good at helping if you know where to ask it to look, but sometimes it is really confusing too. At one point it told me to write JSON on the backend development and I don't have the first idea of where to start there. I am getting better at figuring that out, and more comfortable with naming. I have looked into JSON a little bit prior to this week, and it is interesting.
