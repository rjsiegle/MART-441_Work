For this week, I did use chatgpt to help me to get some of the movements correct. I created a game of tag but was having some issues with collisions scoring points correctly and needed help figuring out how to bounce the square away so points weren't continuously collected on a single collision. I tried to make something playable. I also added buttons to stop and start the music as chrome wouldn't autoplay it (even though Safari does) and also because I like playing games without sound so it made it more functional for me. I did use chatgpt to help with that since chrome wouldn't autoplay and it was confusing me.
