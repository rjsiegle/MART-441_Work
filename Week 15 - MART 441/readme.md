I did use ChatGPt to help this week. I tried to get it to move the individual shapes in the index.html file individually, but that was unsuccesful. I thought the products rendered were alright. I feel like with ChatGPT you have to just keep repeating what you want it to do and it says "Apologies for the oversight" a lot. It's useful for getting things done quickly and for checking the meaning of the errors in the developer console, but it can be a whole days work just getting it to do what you want at times.
