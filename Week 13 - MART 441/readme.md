I had a really difficult time with this weeks project and had to do a ton of debugging to get everything to work. For the homework implementations I:
1. Made the character jump using the spacebar (this was a huge issue for me, but I finally figured it out)
2. Changed the gravity of the stars
3. Added some spikes in the form of broken glass. They were supposed to stay at the top of the screen, but I couldn't figure that out so I will admit, I gave up. 
4. Added an additional platform and adjusted the positions so my character would fit and not get stuck trying to jump. I had attempted to use a ground-tile and that is a known issue with phaser apparently, so nixed that in favor the platform in the homework file. 
5. Created additional graphics (blue bubbles). While I did not give them different values, I did assign them the purpose of getting rid of the bombs. I attempted to have the coke can shoot them but it didn't work, so this was one was to remove the problem of too many bombs showing up that made the game impossible. 

I did use chatgpt for help figuring out why things didn't work. I followed some of the instructions from phasers forums but wasn't having luck so needed a little extra help.
