##Week 12

I did use ChatGPT this week to check my code and for help with the Key Presses. I think this was
the easiest week yet. I wanted to build the squares to make a maze but the spacing was inconsistent 
and I could not figure out why, I assume it may be because of the canvas container setup vh but I am 
not entirely sure. I did not want to spend too long hyperfocusing on that when it appears there are
better methods for building a maze anyway.
