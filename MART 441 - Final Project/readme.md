For the final project, I focused on the project we did the previous week using Babylon. I had initially tried with 3.js, but it was giving me a ton of trouble, so I swapped over to Babylon because it seems to be easier for me to get working. I imported a glb file I found from https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/time-machine-a11c6d625e3f46dca26d6e4c4edf2a79 and then I added a rotation and strobing light effect when the "Travel in time" button is selected. This makes the glb rotate and light up. I then used ChatGPT to help me integrate coding in an API I found from Wikipedia so that when the button is pressed, and a random date is generated, a historically significant event for that date comes up. The wikipedia API hyperlinks to a page about the event. I thought this was kind of a cool way to use some of what we learned. It did take a lot of trial and error over the course of several days, but I am pretty happy with it!
